c0.3.1
*   fixed error when broadcast port or socket timeout is specified in
    weewx.conf
*   fixed bug when decoding firmware version string that resulted in a
    truncated result
v0.3.0
*   added the --units command line option to allow the output of --live-data to
    be displayed in specified units (US customary or Metric)
*   added support for WH35 sensor
*   when run directly the driver now distinguishes between no sensor ID
    response and an empty sensor ID response
*   reworked battery state, signal level and sensor ID processing to cater for
    changes to battery state reporting introduced in GW1000 API v1.6.0 (GW1000
    v1.6.5 firmware)
*   The GW1000 cumulative daily lightning count field is now included in driver
    loop packets as field 'lightningcount' (the default field name). Previously
    this field was used to derive the WeeWX extended schema field
    'lightning_strike_count' and was not included in loop packets.
*   fixed incomplete --default-map output
*   fixes loss of battery state data for some sensors that occurred under
    GW1000 firmware release v1.6.5 and later
v0.2.0
*   added support for WH45 sensor
*   improved comments in installer/wee_config inserted config stanzas/entries
*   sensor signal levels added to loop packet
*   added --get-services command line option to display the GW1000 supported
    weather services settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-pm25-offset command line option to display GW1000 PM2.5 sensor
    offset settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-mulch-offset command line option to display GW1000
    multi-channel TH sensor calibration settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-soil-calibration command line option to display GW1000 soil
    moisture sensor calibration settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-calibration command line option to display GW1000 sensor
    calibration settings when driver is run directly
*   renamed --rain-data command line option to --get-rain-data
*   renamed various 24 hour average particulate concentration fields
*   added a check for unknown field addresses when processing sensor data
v0.1.0
*   initial release
