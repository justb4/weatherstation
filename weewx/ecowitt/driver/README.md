# Ecowitt Driver

See the project https://github.com/iz0qwm/ecowitt_http_gateway .
The full driver is a PHP gateway that can store snapshots in a file.
Subsequently the weewx driver (or any other app) can pickup
these files.

But the weewx driver can also be in "server" mode, i.e. an Ecowitt
device like a GW1000 or a console like the Froggiit DP1500 can POST directly
to a listener in weewx.

Driver: https://github.com/iz0qwm/ecowitt_http_gateway/tree/master/weewx

For now we use the "server" mode, later maybe revisit using PHP proxy.

Opens a socket server that receives directly the GW1000. 
Configure it in the weewx.conf<br>
with the IP address where the GW1000 will connect to. 
Configure the GW1000 with the IP and the port, put / on the path.

Modify weewx.conf:
<pre>
<b>[Station]
     station_type = ecowitt
</b>
</pre>
Check the automatic addition at the end of weewx.conf:<br>
<pre>
<b>
[ecowitt]
     poll_interval = 65                    # number of seconds, just a little more than the GW1000 update time
     path = /var/log/ecowitt/weewx.txt     # location of data file generated by ecowitt_http_gateway used in mode=normal
     driver = weewx.drivers.ecowitt
     mode = normal                         # normal = use with ecowitt_http_gateway - server = directly connected to GW1000
     address = 192.168.2.185               # IP address of the PC where weewx is running in mode=server, to which GW1000 will connect to                
     port = 9999                           # port to which GW1000 will connect to in mode=server
</b>
</pre>
